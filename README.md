# pictureselection

This is a program to select the "best" pictures from a folder.

It is based on 
- the distribution of pictures over the entire period
- the number of pictures that should be selected overall
- the availability of meta data tags, especially "date taken"
- the resolution of pictures and
- the score of each picture according to the BRISQ algorithm
